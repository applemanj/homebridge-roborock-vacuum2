# Changelog

## 1.4.15

- Tightened obstacle photo handling in the map UI to accept only base64-encoded image data and render it through browser-generated blob URLs.
- Added blob URL cleanup when closing or replacing obstacle photos to avoid leaking browser-side object URLs.

## 1.4.14

- Hardened region detection by parsing the configured Roborock host instead of using substring matches.
- Sanitized map obstacle image URLs before assigning them in the browser UI to reduce XSS and client-side redirect risk.
- Added explicit read-only permissions to the CI workflow, upgraded GitHub Actions versions, and moved Codecov uploads to a repository secret.

## 1.4.13

- Adjusted `package.json` repository metadata to match the fork URL exactly for npm Trusted Publishing compatibility.
- Updated the npm publish workflow to use Node 24 and the latest npm CLI for Trusted Publishing compatibility.

## 1.4.12

- Improved model resolution and startup hardening for newer Roborock metadata layouts.
- Added diagnostics in the Homebridge UI for model detection, local key availability, discovery state, local IP, TCP connection state, and last transport used.
- Fixed updater payload crashes caused by malformed or partial cloud/local message payloads.
- Improved room mapping behavior with clearer logging and fallback labels when Roborock room names are missing.
- Replaced forced hourly MQTT reconnects with a health-check-based reconnect path.
- Added guards against transient `0%` battery reports while the robot is docked or charging to reduce false HomeKit low-battery alerts.
- Added regression tests around transport selection, room mapping, and model/diagnostics handling.
- Added incremental TypeScript-style checking for the core transport queue and a `typecheck` script for ongoing migration work.
- Added GitHub Actions automation for npm publishing on `master` using npm Trusted Publishing.
